# uWsgi's build system is Python-based.  
# The build profile (ini format) is used to customize uWSGI servers.
# uWsgi shipped with a set of build profile in buildconf/ folder.
# you could specify your own build profile by set the system 
# environment UWSGI_PROFILE or pass through from the command line.
# $ pythong uwsgiconfig.py --build <path_to_build_profile>
