Buildout to build, config and run HHVM_

HHVM_ proved 9x increase in web requests and 
5x reduction in memory consumption for Facebook!

Isn't that so NICE!?

We will compile and build HHVM_ from source code.
HHVM on github.com has details documents for all kinds of Linux 
distributions.

Dependences
-----------

Some main points:

- HHVM is uing **cmake** to compile and build, need **cmake**
  2.8.4 or higher
- g++ need version 4.8 or higher

RedHat 5 and CentOS 5
---------------------

As the dependence of HHVM_, it will take a lot time and effort
to install HHVM_ on CentOS 5.
Here is a instruction to build HHVM on CentOS 5.2: 
CentOS5.2_HHVM_.
