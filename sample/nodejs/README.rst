How to Get Started
------------------

Create a new **buildout.cfg** file with the following content::

  [buildout]
  extends = 
      buildout-base.cfg

Then execute the following commands::

  $ cd sample/nodejs
  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ bin/buildout

After the buildout executed successfully, you could find 
the following bash scripts in bin folder::

  bin/
    - node
    - npm
    - bower

How to use bower?
-----------------

For example using bower_ to install bootstrap_ framework::

  $ cd sample/nodejs
  $ bin/bower install bootstrap

We can specify which version we want for a module::

  $ bin/bower install bootstrap#2.x

How about private npm repo?
---------------------------

The npm_ repository is very good repository.
Still, there are many benefits to create a private npm repo:

- When npm_ is down or outage.
- When you are working behind a firewall.

Here are some good post talking about this topic.
