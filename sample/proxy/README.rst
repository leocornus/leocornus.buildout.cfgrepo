Try to provide some sample to build and config different kind of
Proxy Servers by using buildout.

Based on Wikipedia `Proxy Server <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server>`_
page, there are 3 types of Proxy servers:

- Forward proxy
- Open proxy
- Reverse proxy

'''Forward Proxy'''

Squid_ is the best choice for Forward proxy server.
