Composer for WordPress and MediaWiki
====================================

Seems composer is the choice for manage WordPress and MediaWiki

Composer Basic
--------------



Conposer for WordPress Plugins and Themes
-----------------------------------------

Some ideas:

- using composer to auto download plugins and themes.
  mainly from site https://wpackagist.org.
- using buildout part to genearte **composer.json**
- buildout part will have full list of plugins and themes.

composer **extra installer-paths** will be used to configure
the install path for plugins and themes.
